productApi:
-> When use using a CRUD operation we use a dependencies are:  
1) express: The command is yarn add express --save    it will download all the required elements 
                                                      in the internet
2) MySQL: The command is yarn add mysql --save   Ths will download mysql dependency
When I'am getting an error using these commands are:
* yarn outdated  * yarn cache clean   * yarn install then using yarn add mysql --save

step 1 - is to establish a database connection, we are going to use two files are:
         1) db_connection.js - This will responsible for creating database connection and 
            returning it mysql modules   
         2) db_properties.js - This will store the connection information, this will used by 
            db_connection.js
step 2 - is to creating a controller that will host our RESTful API's, this controller use the
         db_connection and routes 

Routers:
Routing is what application is do when the user navigates to from one web page to another in a web 
application 
In traditional web application: Before single page application the way it is to work is that the 
application is running on the browser will send a request to the server, server is process the 
request and send back to the next view back to the browser, So the routing and navigation
is happen to the server side
But in case single page application the entire routing is done on the client side.

Angular provides router modules which is super easy to configure of our routing application 
there are three important components of routing are:
1) Routes - This routes repersents all routes navigation links with our application
2) RouterOutlet - This is the place holder component that shows angular where to put contents of 
                  each router
3) RouterLink - Using this link to add a link to our html pages and click onto the link automatically
                client will be routed to appropriate to the page or router 

When we working on routing these three link is important

1) Create routing.module.ts
2) Create <routing-outlet> in html
3) import routing.module.ts in to AppModule
