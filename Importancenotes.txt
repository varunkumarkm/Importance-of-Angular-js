1) Single page application
-> spa's are web applications that run entirely in a web browser and do not need a any page reloades.
   In single page application the will loaded at initially once, and the user access the web application
   that is why the name is single page application.
   ex: facebook and gmail
   In facebook, when we click on one page to another it will not refreashing

Advantages:
   * It provides a great user experience
   * It is very fast
   * It's very easy to develop, Because we seperate out the backend and frontend
   * spa's can work offline, once all the data is featched 

Disadvantages:
   * spa's are less secure, Because we need to interact backend side, 
     we need to enabled cross-site scripting
   * chances for memory leak, we can handle it javaScript memory leaks properly 

2) Traditional page application
-> when a user when using our we application, user click on a button or a link, request will sent to a 
   server, and server side code is responsible for generating brand new UI or a html page which will be 
   send back to the browser, result in a page refresh

3) What Angular js is and why?
-> * Angular js is a spa's developement framework or platform, that is using HTML and TypeScript

     Architectural feature:
   * Using Angular js we can quickly and easily build a single page applications.
   * The first architectural feature is component

4)  Component:
    * Every angular application is made up of one component, a component is a combination of
    data and logic and associated with HTML templates that renders with the using logics on to 
    the web browser
    * Every application will have root component followed by the several other components 
    renders the different parts of our application on to the browser
    * For every application will have the root component followed by the several other components
    we have to render different parts of our application on to the browser

5)  HTML template:
    * The html template than we can use two other cool feature as to offer namely:
    1) Angular Directives    2) Data Binding

    1) Angular Directives - Using angular directives, we can define logic in our HTML page
    2) Data Binding - Using data binding we can bind the data to the HTML DOM element.
       There are two types of data binding are:
       * Event Binding and *Property Binding 
       
       *Event Binding - this is button click and or when the user places a mouse to text or input field etc.
       *property binding - which will bind the HTML input properties to the model in our application component

6)  Service:
    service is a class are used to featch the data from the backend, Angular knows how to use services
    whatever services we write we can use dependency injection to inject that service into a component
    and then the component in use the service to featch the data and render it onto the UI
    So, Dependency injection and services are other cool features of Angular

    Routing:
    As the user clicks on the button or link are the browser back button, we need to routing to the 
    appropriate view.
    Angular provides routing module which can use to easily map url paths to views instead of pages

    Versions of Angular: 
    -> The major changes of angular version is Angular 2, its completly different on Angular 1.0
    Angular 4 5 and 6 is the minor updates

7) How to install and how to use the latest version of Angular CLI:
   1) install a node-js
   2) install the angular CLI using the command - npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
                                               npm install -g @angular/cli
   3) ng version - This command is shows a angular version
   4) ng new my-app - This is the command we used to create a project
   -> asking stricter type checking - yes , it will be very benitial, our application code strictly
   checked for type of data we deal with
   -> Would you like angular routing - ignore add it later, when we required
   -> Go to the inside of the project folder ex: cd my-app
   -> ng serve -o - This is command we run our application into the browser
   -> yarn installation on google, just type yarn installation or npm install --global yarn use this command

   Practical:

Component - A component is a key feature of an angular using which we will create our own HTML like 
            elements are:
            <navbar>    <mymenu>   <footer> 
            These are all custom HTML tag or custom elements which are there own look and behaviour
            and we create this using existing html elements are:
            <div>  <h1>  <a>   <from> etc.


8)  NgModules or Router - The basic building block of a angular application are: ngModule or AngularModules
            So ngModule defines a compilation context for a set of components or a services that address
            a particular functionality of our application    
Advantages: * Easy maintainable or code and then reuseability    

Amgular supports two way of binding?
-> 1) Input way of binding  - [hiddden]=true or false, or else add a property for component, the pass 
                              property name hide or anything ex: [hiddden]='hide'
   2) output way of binding - It is used to when we hide the Input binding, it supports show that 
                              binding to the users ex:
                              <input type="button" value="Toggle" (click)="hide=!hide"/>

9) Directives:
-> Directives means in html, we added to attribute in our HTML elements, which will dynamically
   effect the HTML DOM 
    1) ngIf - This directives is used to display a html conditionally
       ex: <b *ngIf='true'>My text</b>   if its true directly added to the HTML DOM, if false not added
    2) ngSwitch - When we use ngSwitch the elements is matches with the ngSwitchs case then will be
       displayed 
       ex: <div [ngSwitch] = 'mycase'>
           <div *ngSwitchCase = '''one'''>
           <div *ngSwitchCase = '''two'''>
           <div *ngDefaultCase = '''one'''>
    3) ngFor - As the name itself says it is used to repeate given DOM element based on each element
               in an array 
               ex: <div *ngFor='let c of cources'>
                      <b>c</b>   
                   </div>
    4) ngNonBindable - It is used to tell angular not to bing or compiler part of our page
             ex: <div>{{myData}}</div>
    5) ngstyle  and  ngClass  - This will used to styling purpose  
       ngStyle - [style.<cssproperty>]='values'
       ngClass - it is directly assign particular css to the html elements
                 ex: [ngClass] = "{tdata:true}" 

10) Dependency injection?
-> When we build huge software application or single page applications, we don't put all the 
   code in one single component, that code will be spread across the component

   To do dependency injection on angular the two steps are:
   1) step-1 - First Register any component or any dependency inside the ngModule, 
                 that is app.module.ts
   2) step-2 - Is to use or inject itself we do that simply provided a constructor
